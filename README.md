# PiLapse

This repository is for the development of a standalone Raspi Timelapse Camera. It currently has major issues *including* licensing so it is strongly reccomended that you wait a few days before using it.

The goal of this project is to provide a fully functional timelapse camera for short-ish time lapses. This includes a 3d printed case, assembly instructions, installation scripts, and fully made sd-card images.

## Adafruit Pi-Cam
Some of the code in this repository has been cloned from [the Adafruit-Pi-Cam](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-pi-cam) repository. The licence there applies to several parts of this software relating to the displaying of live images on screen. A copy of the licence is provided in the yuv2rgb folder.
